Title: Development of a React-based Todo List Application

Introduction:
In this essay, I will discuss the development process and key features of a Todo List application I created using React. Although I successfully implemented most requested functions, including task creation, deletion, editing, and marking tasks as complete, the drag-and-drop functionality for task reordering is yet to be implemented. The application has been deployed to the cloud and can be accessed through this link: Todo List Application.

Development Process:
I chose React for its efficient and flexible framework in creating interactive user interfaces. Utilizing React's component-based architecture allowed for modularization, ensuring maintainability and code reusability.

Key Features:

Task Creation: Users can easily create new tasks by inputting task details and clicking "Add," facilitating efficient task management.

Task Deletion: Each task includes a delete button for easy removal, maintaining a clutter-free task list.

Task Editing: Users can modify task details by clicking on the task itself, providing flexibility in adjusting descriptions or updating information.

Marking Tasks as Complete: Users can check a checkbox to indicate task completion, aiding progress tracking and motivating task completion.

Limitation:
The application currently lacks drag-and-drop functionality for task reordering, a feature that would enhance user customization and task prioritization.

Deployment:
The Todo List application has been deployed to the cloud using Vercel, enabling convenient access without local installations or setup. Access the deployed version here: Todo List Application.
